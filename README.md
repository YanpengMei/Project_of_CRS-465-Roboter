Author: Yanpeng Mei

Completed on: 20. Jan. 2021

Matlab Version: R2020b

This small project is from my course "Modellierung und Simulation in der Mechatronik". 

This project is about the modeling, simulation and controller design of the CRS 465 robot arm.

It is not so difficult to complete but very interesting. You can find more information in the brief report.
